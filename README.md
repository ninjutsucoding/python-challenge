 Module 3

Most of the code I got from referencing the class activities

I did get a few things from outside

print("-"*40) code I got from a post on reddit

I tried to use the index to count the votes at first and that didn't work.   We learned about count in class
but i had did do a online search for a refresher and found the information on stack.overflow.com
Learning so much, it can be hard to go back and try to find a specific function in the notes or activities.  
I feel its faster to just search online.   

I learned about the set command from youtube video from nevsky.programming

to create line spaces by using print(), i found that on stack.overflow.com
